# SEA
Sampling Emergent Attention

Code for modeling bidirectional influences of information-sampling and concept-learning.

## Requirements
- Python 3+
- Numpy

## Recommended 
(Required to run some of the existing simulations)
- tqdm (https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
- pandas
- seaborn
- itertools

## Overview
- To use, simply clone the repo. You can add the SEA folder to your PYTHONPATH (in which case, you would import as "from SEA import sea"), or save new simulations in the '''simulations''' folder. 
- Example simulations (in the form of jupyter notebooks) are included in this folder. These are those that are reported in the paper.
- "sim_less_is_more.ipynb" is the simplest simulation, and might be the best place to start.

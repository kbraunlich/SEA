- Numpy

## Recommended 
*(Required for existing simulations)*
- tqdm (https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
- pandas
- seaborn
- itertools

## Overview
- To use, clone the repo, and then either add the SEA folder to your PYTHONPATH (import as "from SEA import sea"), or run new simulations from the "simulations" folder. 
- Examples (the simulations reported in the paper) are available in the "simulations" folder (in the form of jupyter notebooks).

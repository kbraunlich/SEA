# SEA
Sampling Emergent Attention

Code for modeling bidirectional influences of information-sampling and concept-learning.

## Requirements
- Python 3+
- Numpy

## Recommended 
(Required to run some of the existing simulations)
- tqdm (https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
- pandas
- seaborn
- itertools

## Overview
- To use, simply clone the repo. You can add the SEA folder to your PYTHONPATH, or you can simply save your own simulations in the '''simulations''' folder. 
- Example simulations (in the form of jupyter notebooks) are included in the simulations folder. These are the simulations reported in the paper.
- "sim_less_is_more.ipynb" might be the simplest simulations, and is probably a good place to start...
